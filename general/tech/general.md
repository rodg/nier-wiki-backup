Automata has a lot of idiosyncrasies in it's mechanics and how they interact. Because of that there are a lot of things we can exploit and use to our advantage in a speedrun. To better understand the underlying mechanisms also refer to [Game Behaviour](/general/game-behaviour-overview). This page is about all the tech that is neither clearly [Combat](/general/tech/combat) or [Movement](/general/tech/movement) tech in itself, but can require use of them.
# Slow-mo
Slow-mo is a very escential technic that has a wide range of uses. It helps in combat and with movement, as well as some other aplications. It is used to slow down most aspects of the game world excluding the player.
### Execution
Hold the Pod Program Button to charge your Pod Program, during the first few seconds of crage up the world will be slowed. To refresh the slow-mo when it runs out cancel the program and immediatly charge it again.

The easiest way to cancel a Pod Program is by briefly using Pod Fire.
It can also be canceled by letting go of the button while SD is held, or during the start of a dash.
A Pod Program is also not discharged after fully self destructing.
### Requirements
A chargeable Pod Program has to be equiped on the active Pod (first aquired during the Marx 1 fight) and it has to be off cooldown.
The majority of all Pod Programs are chargeable, exceptions are: Wire
### Additional Notes
- The Quick access Menu cannot be used during Slow-mo, redering you temporarily unable to use Healing items or switch weapon sets while Slow-mo is held
- Toggleing fashlight to taunt is still possible during Slow-mo
- Holding Slow-mo during an aerial combo makes the player unable to glide with the Pod or Podspin
- Slow-mo can be performed simultaniously with holding SD
