Automata has a lot of idiosyncrasies in it's mechanics and how they interact. Because of that there are a lot of things we can exploit and use to our advantage in a speedrun. To better understand the underlying mechanisms also refer to [Game Behaviour](/general/game-behaviour-overview). This page is about all the tech that is neither clearly [Combat](/general/tech/combat) or [Movement](/general/tech/movement) tech in itself, but can require or augment them.
# Slow-mo
Slow-mo is a very escential technic that has a wide range of uses. It helps in combat and with movement, as well as some other aplications. It is used to **slow down** most aspects of the **game world** excluding the player.
### Execution
**Hold** the **Pod Program** Button to charge your Pod Program, during the first few seconds of crage up the world will be slowed. To refresh the slow-mo when it runs out **cancel** the program and immediatly **charge it again**.

The easiest way to cancel a Pod Program is by briefly using Pod Fire.
It can also be canceled by letting go of the button while SD is held, or during the start of a dash.
A Pod Program is also not discharged after fully self destructing.
### Requirements
A **chargeable Pod Program** has to be equiped on the active Pod (first aquired during the Marx 1 fight) and it has to be **off cooldown**.
The majority of all Pod Programs are chargeable, exceptions are: Wire
*(editor note: check for more)*
### Additional Notes
- The Quick access Menu cannot be used during Slow-mo, redering you temporarily unable to use Healing items or switch weapon sets while Slow-mo is held
- Toggleing fashlight to taunt is still possible during Slow-mo
- Holding Slow-mo during an aerial combo makes the player unable to glide with the Pod or Podspin
- Slow-mo can be performed simultaniously with holding SD

# Self Destruct
If there is one universally useful and powerful tool at our disposal, the **Self Destruct** function or **SD** for short would be a top contender. Playing casually some people might use it to blow up 2B's skirt, but then most likely never touch it again.
Due to it's properties however it is a very versitile ability that enables a wide variaty of tech.
### Requirements
SD becomes available **immediatly after completing the Prologue** of the game. (actually even before the start-up menu sequence)
Since Self Destruct is used so much and being able to press it for very short durations at a time is very important, it is **highly recommended to rebind** it to a button that is comfortable to press.
Most Runners will have it bound to either **Bumper** (more commonly L1 / LB) or the **D-Pad**.
### Aplications
- When tapped SD will cancel any action the chracter is currently in and return them to an idle state. 
	It can therefor also be used to asure an idle player state or comming to a dead stop at any time.
- Letting go of SD when tapping or previously holding it will instantly kill all momentum the character has except for falling momentum.
- When the player already has momentum when starting to hold SD (eg. from a Plunge) the momentum will be maintained until the button is released.
- Repeatedly tapping SD while falling prevents the character from going into a belly flop animation and additionally negates all fall damage.
- When canceling an attack with SD the combo will still be advanced, so it can skip to later attacks in any combo.
- Canceling most combo attacks before their conclusion will reset the attack enableing the player to repeatedly use it.
 (eg. used for Spear Dashing)
- Can be used to cancel and perform an additional heavy attack during an Aerial combo.
- Fully executing a self destruct deals a large amount of damage to anything around the character and reduces HP to 1.
SD damage is increased by WAU (weapon attack up) chips and Melee attack buffs, as well as taunt.
A full SD is most commonly used just before a cutscene, since that gets around the long stagger afterwards.
### Additional Notes
- Being in a state of SD stagger or holding SD when a cutscene starts diables pausing for that cutscene.
The only way to skip the cutscene in that case is with holding B / Circle.
