# To Do

- glossary -> wip [here](/lookUp/glossary)
- also list of skips based on category here, tiny descriptions of skips and links to respective pages -> wip [here](/skipLists/skip-list-any)
- Beginner's guide and shit (wip in /intro but not sure about the structure: should there be one giant beginner page or multiple smaller linked to by the beginner page?)

### Videos

# Page ideas
