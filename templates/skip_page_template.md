# Overview
This is a consize overview of what this skip is, why it is done and what defining characteriscia are.

# Variations
The different ways to do this trick ordered in increasing difficulty.

# Variation Tabs {.tabset}
## Variation 1
This version is the easiest because it makes use of the fact that a bare fist lift gains a lot more height than the one with the small sword that we usually use.
The downside being that you lose time switching weapons in the menu.

<table>
<tr><th>Required Weapon Set configuration</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><td>

| Weapon Set 1 |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Light Attack 	| [ *Any* ] |
| Heavy Attack | Bare Fist |

</td><td>

| Weapon Set 2 |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Light Attack 	| [ *Large Sword* ] |
| Heavy Attack | [ *Small Sword* ] |

</td></tr> </table>

Assuming you're doing this in prologue you'll just have to swap **Virtuous Treaty** for **Bare Fist** in **Weapon Set 1**.
Switch to **Weapon Set 1** and do the following combo to jump onto the raised bridge:

**Lift &rarr; Switch WS &rarr; Light &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Jump &rarr; Light &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Plunge**

- The lift should be a delayed lift.
- The plunge shouldn't be instant, let the dash animation start and then plunge. If you do an Instant Plunge, you won't be able to dash off right away.
- Make sure you're not rushing your inputs. Let your Heavy Attacks and jumps play out until you get enough height.
- The second Light Attack needs to be done during the ascending phase of your jump.


## Variation 2
The original way of doing this high jump.

<tr><th>Required Weapon Set configuration</th></tr>
<tr><td>

| Weapon Set (any) | |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Light Attack | [ *Large Sword* ] |
| Heavy Attack | [ *Small Sword* ] |

</td></tr> </table>

In prologue this will correspond to **Weapon Set 2**.
Using this Weapon Set, do the following combo to jump onto the raised bridge:

**Lift &rarr; Light &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Jump &rarr; Light &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Plunge**

- Properly delaying the lift is crucial to achieve the necessary height.
- The plunge shouldn't be instant, let the dash animation start and then plunge. If you do an Instant Plunge, you won't be able to dash off right away.
- Make sure you're not rushing your inputs. Let your Heavy Attacks and jumps play out until you get enough height.
- The second Light Attack needs to be done during the ascending phase of your jump.

# Skip Second Part
Start holding Dash during the plunge. This will skip the slam into the ground and start your dash instantly.

After this dash, there are a couple of different ways to get to the other side.

## Optimal Version

**Dash &rarr; Jump &rarr; Jump &rarr; Switch WS &rarr; Plunge**

- The switching of Weapon Sets can be done in many places other than the one mentioned above. Most common places are before the first Dash or right before the ending Dash for the plunge.
- Don't rush your jump inputs. Leave some space in between to cover more horizontal distance.
- Make sure to do your first Jump after your Dash ends. If not, you will get a "standing jump" which will have much less forward momentum.

Swapping WS during a Dash will cut it off, so after getting to the other side, swap WS in *between* dashes.

## Easier Version
**Dash &rarr; Jump &rarr; Podspin &rarr; Jump &rarr; Podspin &rarr; Dash**

- There are many other ways to do this. The one provided is just a safe option to get you started.
