# Basic Mechanics
The player can choose between two weapon sets. For A2 and 2B, each set has two slots labeled "Light Attack" and "Heavy Attack". 9S only has the "Light Attack" with the button normally associated with "Heavy Attack" being used for hacking instead.

In conversation "Light Attack" and "Heavy Attack" are usually shortened to "light" and "heavy" respectively. This article will also refer to them in this way going forth.

Weapon Set 1 and Weapon Set 2 are independent from each other, so the same weapon can be equipped in both.
Within one Weapon Set a weapon can only be equipped once (apart from Bare Fists). Any weapon can be equipped in any slot: *Light attack* **does not** mean *small sword*! A weapon will have different attack animations depending on which slot it is equipped in.

During gameplay the player is free to switch between weapon sets at will and with virtually no limitations. Changing the equipped weapons in the sets can only be done in the menu which is only accessable while grounded.

# Use in speedrunning
Because most of the [Movement Tech](/intro/movement) uses attack animations, the configuration of weapon sets and switching between them is very important in speedrunning.
