## Podlaunch
Do a running Double Jump so that you're in the apex of your jump just before hitting the trigger. Then, Podlaunch. Make sure you're holding Left until you land.

## Heavy Hold
Heavy Hold to the left just before hitting the trigger. Commonly done with a Delayed Heavy Hold for easier lineup.
