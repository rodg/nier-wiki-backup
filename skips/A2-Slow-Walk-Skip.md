## Podlaunch
Do a running Double Jump so that you're in  the apex of your jump just before hitting the trigger. Then, Podlaunch. (Make sure you're holding Left until you land?)

## Heavy Hold
Heavy Hold to the left just before hitting the trigger. The Heavy Hold is commonly done with Dashing into place and starting the Heavy Hold during the Dash (to avoid getting a Dash Swing). (( WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A TERM FOR THIS EXPLAINING IT EVERY TIME IS WEIRD))
