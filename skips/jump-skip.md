Area: Factory
Character: 2B

# Overview
Jump Skip avoids 2B's jump animation after the Silo-1 fight to start the cutscene of Marx-1 destroying the silo earlier.

# Execution
To get this skip you should be pre-throwing a DG where the Medium Biped is going to land.

Walk around the biped while the spinning sword damages it.

When done correctly the cutscene of 2B kicking the biped against the silo wall should be playing instantly when its health reaches zero as opposed to her jumping up, leaving the screen.

This skip saves around half a second.
