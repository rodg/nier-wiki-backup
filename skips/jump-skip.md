Area: Factory, Deep Factory
Character: 2B

# Overview
Jump-up Skip avoids 2B's jump animation upon defeating an enemy who's death triggers a cutscene.

It can be performed after the Silo-1 fight to start the cutscene of Marx destroying the silo earlier, as well as after defeating So-Shi in deep factory.

# Execution
To get this skip is Silo-1 you should be pre-throwing a DG where the Medium Biped is going to land.
For So-Shi throw a DG as soon as he has retraced his legs and is about to bounce up.

Make sure to be walking while the spinning sword damages the enemy.
The direction you walk in doesn't matter because 2B being in her walk animation is the desciding factor.

When done correctly the respective cutscene should be playing instantly when the enemies health reaches zero as opposed to 2B jumping up, leaving the screen.
This skip saves around half a second.
