# Overview
Lava Out Of Bounds is a skip consisting of two clipouts in the abandoned factory commonly used to take a shortcut from the bridge terminal room (room after bridge skip) to Silo 3 in prologue and on the way out of Deep Factory.
# Going out of bounds

Required Weapon Set configuration: 

| Weapon Set (any) | |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Light Attack | [ *Any* ] |
| Heavy Attack | [ *Small Sword* ] |

To perform this clipout, get into the corner under the walkway just outside the room that leads to the bridge, hold the stick roughly up right and use the following combo to get out of bounds:

**Lift &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Jump &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Plunge**

# Scaffolding clip
// TODO

## Variation Tabs {.tabset}
### Prologue
Podlaunch into the gap between the scaffolding and the wall to the right. Time your Dash so you get out of the Podlaunch immediately after you clip in, Otherwise you may get stuck between the scaffolding and the wall.

If you do get stuck, podlaunch straight ahead.
### Deep Factory
The regular podlaunch method doesn't work here since the enemies nearby are auto locked on to. Instead, Double Jump and Light Attack into the gap between the scaffolding and the wall.
