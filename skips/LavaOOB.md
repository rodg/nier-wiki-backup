# Overview
Lava Out Of Bounds is a clipout in the abandoned factory commonly used to take a shorter line from Silo 2 to Silo 3 in prologue and on the way out of Deep Factory.
There are two parts to this: The clipout itself and then another clip through some scaffolding.

# Going out of bounds

Required Weapon Set configuration: 

| Weapon Set (any) | |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Light Attack | [ *Any* ] |

To perform this clipout, get into the corner under the walkway just outside the room that leads to the bridge, hold the stick roughly up right and use the following combo to get out of bounds:

**Lift &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Jump &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Plunge**
