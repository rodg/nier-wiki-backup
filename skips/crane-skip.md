# Overview/Description
Crane skip is a shortcut between silo 1 and silo 2 using the catwalk behind the crane. It's reatched by either jumping onto the Crane or making it there out of bounds.

## Crane
*Usually this variation is meant when just referring to "Crane Skip"*
**Edit** (
This version is the easiest because it makes use of the fact that a bare fist lift gains a lot more height than the one with the small sword that we usually use.
The downside being that you lose time switching weapons in the menu.
)

Required Weapon Set configuration:

| Weapon Set (any) ||
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Light Attack 	| [ *Any* ] | 
| Heavy Attack | [ *Small Sword* ] | 

In Prologue this will correspond to **Weapon Set 2**.
**Edit** (
Switch to **Weapon Set 1** and do the following combo to jump onto the raised bridge:


**Lift &rarr; Switch WS &rarr; Light &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Jump &rarr; Light &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Plunge**

- The lift should be a delayed lift.
- The plunge shouldn't be instant, let the dash animation start and then plunge. If you do an Instant Plunge, you won't be able to dash off right away.
- Make sure you're not rushing your inputs. Let your Heavy Attacks and jumps play out until you get enough height.
- The second Light Attack needs to be done during the ascending phase of your jump.

## Heavy Hold
*Might also be referred to as "Crane Skip Skip" or "CSS" for short* 

## Copium Clip
*Might also be referred to as "Crane Skip Skip Skip"*
