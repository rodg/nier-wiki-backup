# Overview/Description
Crane skip is a shortcut between silo 1 and silo 2 using the catwalk behind the crane. It's reatched by either jumping onto the Crane or making it there out of bounds.

# ????????? {.tabset}
## Crane Skip
Regular Crane Skip. The idea is to use the crate to get on top of the ??platform?? to then get on top of the crane.
In Prologue this will correspond to **Weapon Set 2**.
**Edit** (
Switch to **Weapon Set 1** and do the following combo to jump onto the raised bridge:


**Lift &rarr; Switch WS &rarr; Light &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Jump &rarr; Light &rarr; Heavy &rarr; Plunge**

- The lift should be a delayed lift.
- The plunge shouldn't be instant, let the dash animation start and then plunge. If you do an Instant Plunge, you won't be able to dash off right away.
- Make sure you're not rushing your inputs. Let your Heavy Attacks and jumps play out until you get enough height.
- The second Light Attack needs to be done during the ascending phase of your jump.
